Review recent changes to the codebase and update CLAUDE.md and README.md to reflect any new or modified functionality:

1. Check git status and recent commits to identify what changed
2. Read both CLAUDE.md and README.md
3. Update the documentation to reflect the current state:
   - Commands section (new flags, options, scripts)
   - Architecture section (new files, modules)
   - Directory structure (new files/folders)
   - Any other relevant sections

Keep the documentation concise and consistent with the existing style.
